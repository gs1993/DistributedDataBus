# Distributed Data Bus

## Architecture
![Architecture](https://github.com/gs1993/DistributedDataBus/blob/master/docs/Architecture.jpg)

## Features

### gRPC
Used for synchronous communication between API Gateway and microservices, due to its lightweight nature

### Asynchronous messaging - RabbitMq
1. Easy scalable - multiple consumer instances can be added as needed to handle request pick
1. Resiliency - if one service fails on an asynchronous system,  other services will not be affected. The task will be held until the service is up and running again.

### API Gateway
Stateless API Gateway to the system act as single entry point for the clients

Benefits:
1. Horizontal scalability
2. Cache
3. Rate limitting - protection against Denial Of Service (DOS) attacks and degraded performance due to traffic spikes
